# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 19, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Day 001 #100DaysOfCode
I know c++ and trying to solve questions from #codechef. I was doing the easy section and still it's getting tough for me even though i am not a newbie. Did 6 questions 2 from easy and 4 from beginner.
Seriously want to improve my coding. 
Problems I did 1.LUCKFOUR, 2.DIFFSUM, 3.DECINC, 4.CHFPARTY, 5.NUM239, 6.FSQRT

**Thoughts:** The easy problems are taking a lot time to solve currently. Hope to reduce this time as soon as possible.

### Day 2: December 20, 2019



**Today's Progress**: 
Did 6 questions today. There was a question in November Cookoff 2019 named SIGNATURE. Tried to understand it for atleast an hour but could only understand it partially. But I managed to do the 1st question of the Cookoff pretty easily.
Problems I did 1.PPSUM, 2.ICL1902, 3.DIET, 4.CSUM, 5.SNCKYEAR, 6.SAFEROBO

Things are not very clear right. I am just solving questions from codechef and also having a hard time solving them. But I am sure that things would be much better if I keep practicing everyday and stay focused. And maybe, after few months, when I look back at these posts, I would realise that I started from these humble beginnings. And these humble beginnings would be the reason for me doing good in the future.

Cheers

### Day 3: December 21, 2019



**Today's Progress**: 
 
Did 6 #cplusplus beginner questions from #codechef(mostly very basic ones). But I can see a little change in my coding style and I am learning things(INT_MAX,min(),etc).Questions I solved today are 1.CHOPRT, 2.FLOW008, 3.FLOW005, 4.TWOVSTEN, 5.AMR15A, 6.MDL

Tommorow is the Decmber CookOff and I want to be able to solve atleast 1 question.

### Day 4: December 22, 2019



**Today's Progress**: 

Finally participated in the **December CookOff** and was able to solve 2 questions but one was exceeding the time limit(solution was correct though). And I am happy that I was able to solve them. There was another which I understood & was trying to solve but couldn't do so. 

I also saw vedios of STL by Saurabh Shukla on youtube(I should have seen more). Solved 2 questions, one from codechef and another from spoj. 

Not a bad day but not very productive one either. 

Practice questions are 1.HRDSEQ(CODECHEF), 2.PRIME GENERATOR(SPOJ) and 2 from CookOff 3.CHNGIT, 4.XORIT

3.CHNGIT https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/28444654

4.XORIT https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/28449353  (It was not accepted as it exceeded the time limit)


### Day 5: December 23, 2019



**Today's Progress**:

Did 7 questions today but mostly basic ones.Some were very easy like reversing digits(need to focus on little tougher problems). Learnt about **<boost/multiprecision>** in #cplusplus. 

**<boost/multiprecision>** helps to do deal with large numbers(life saver). Because of it was finally able to solve a factorial problem which dealt with large numbers. 

Learning new things everyday. Would try some difficult problems tomorrow. 

Problems I did today are 1.FCTRL2, 2.FLOW017, 3.FLOW018, 4.FLOW007, 5.FLOW004, 6.FLOW001, 7.ADDING REVERSED NUMBERS

### Day 6: December 24, 2019



**Today's Progress**:

So I did 6 questions in #cplusplus from @codechef and @spoj.

Learnt to count trailing 0's in a very large number.

Practice, Practice, Practice is the key.

### Day 8: December 26, 2019



**Today's Progress**:

#100DaysOfCode #cplusplus #programmer #technology

Did 6 questions from spoj. The level of questions that I did today was higher than the ones I was doing earlier. 

Improving logic, increasing speed. 

Procastination is a big trouble. :P

Need to work on procastination habits, time management and the list goes on.

The #hustle is on.

The questions that I did today 1.NUMBER STEPS, 2.FEYNMAN, 3.SMALL FACTORIALS, 4.WHAT'S NEXT, 5.CANDY 1, 6.FASHION SHOWS 

I repeated the factorial question today as it had a new concept that i learnt few days back which helps to handle the large numbers. So it was a brush up.

**Link to work**  

(No links. All the problems were from  spoj)




### Day 9: December 27, 2019



**Today's Progress**:

#100DaysOfCode #cplusplus #programmer

And here I am to do things the better way.Highlights

cheers 

The questions that I did today 1.PD33, 2.FLOW016, 3.GDOG, 4.FLOW011, 5.HEADBOB


### Future Me to Present Me: You are doing a great job by following this schedule. I know there are a lot of consufions right now. But if you try to focus on evrything at a time, it would lead to chaos. Focus on one fundamental thing (which youu believe would be the base for things you will learn or are learning) and other things will fall into place. You will be so happy that you did this cpp challenge ###

@spoj where only 3 were accepted. The Last Digit problem got accepeted on codechef but not getting accepted on spoj.

Want to be super good in @programming. I've managed to stick to c++ since 21 days and that in itself is a very big achievement.

But now I'll have to put more effort and learn advance things because I can't just be doing things which I am comfortable with.

The questions that I did are 1.CANDY III, 2.JULKA, 3.TRANSFORM THE EXPRESSION
