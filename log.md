# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 19, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Day 001 #100DaysOfCode
I know c++ and trying to solve questions from #codechef. I was doing the easy section and still it's getting tough for me even though i am not a newbie. Did 6 questions 2 from easy and 4 from beginner.
Seriously want to improve my coding. 
Problems I did 1.LUCKFOUR, 2.DIFFSUM, 3.DECINC, 4.CHFPARTY, 5.NUM239, 6.FSQRT

**Thoughts:** The easy problems are taking a lot time to solve currently. Hope to reduce this time as soon as possible.
