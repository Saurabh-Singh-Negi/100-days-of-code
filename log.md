# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 19, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Day 001 #100DaysOfCode
I know c++ and trying to solve questions from #codechef. I was doing the easy section and still it's getting tough for me even though i am not a newbie. Did 6 questions 2 from easy and 4 from beginner.
Seriously want to improve my coding. 
Problems I did 1.LUCKFOUR, 2.DIFFSUM, 3.DECINC, 4.CHFPARTY, 5.NUM239, 6.FSQRT

**Thoughts:** The easy problems are taking a lot time to solve currently. Hope to reduce this time as soon as possible.

### Day 2: December 20, 2019



**Today's Progress**: 
Did 6 questions today. There was a question in November Cookoff 2019 named SIGNATURE. Tried to understand it for atleast an hour but could only understand it partially. But I managed to do the 1st question of the Cookoff pretty easily.
Problems I did 1.PPSUM, 2.ICL1902, 3.DIET, 4.CSUM, 5.SNCKYEAR, 6.SAFEROBO

Things are not very clear right. I am just solving questions from codechef and also having a hard time solving them. But I am sure that things would be much better if I keep practicing everyday and stay focused. And maybe, after few months, when I look back at these posts, I would realise that I started from these humble beginnings. And these humble beginnings would be the reason for me doing good in the future.

Cheers

### Day 4: December 22, 2019



**Today's Progress**: 

Finally participated in the **December CookOff** and was able to solve 2 questions but one was exceeding the time limit(solution was correct though). And I am happy thet I was able to solve them. There was another which I understood & was trying to solve but couldn't do so. I also saw vedios of STL by Saurabh Shukla on youtube(I should have seen more). Solved 2 questions, one from codechef and another from spoj. Not a bad day but not very productive one either. Practice questions are 1.HRDSEQ(CODECHEF), 2.PRIME GENERATOR(SPOJ) and 2 from CookOff 3.CHNGIT, 4.XORIT

4.XORIT https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/28449353  (It was not accepted as it exceeded the time limit)
