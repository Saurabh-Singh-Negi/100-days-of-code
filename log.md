# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 19, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Day 001 #100DaysOfCode
I know c++ and trying to solve questions from #codechef. I was doing the easy section and still it's getting tough for me even though i am not a newbie. Did 6 questions 2 from easy and 4 from beginner.
Seriously want to improve my coding. 
Problems I did 1.LUCKFOUR, 2.DIFFSUM, 3.DECINC, 4.CHFPARTY, 5.NUM239, 6.FSQRT

**Thoughts:** The easy problems are taking a lot time to solve currently. Hope to reduce this time as soon as possible.

### Day 2: December 20, 2019



**Today's Progress**: 
Did 6 questions today. There was a question in November Cookoff 2019 named SIGNATURE. Tried to understand it for atleast an hour but could only understand it partially. But I managed to do the 1st question of the Cookoff pretty easily.
Problems I did 1.PPSUM, 2.ICL1902, 3.DIET, 4.CSUM, 5.SNCKYEAR, 6.SAFEROBO

Things are not very clear right. I am just solving questions from codechef and also having a hard time solving them. But I am sure that things would be much better if I keep practicing everyday and stay focused. And maybe, after few months, when I look back at these posts, I would realise that I started from these humble beginnings. And these humble beginnings would be the reason for me doing good in the future.

Cheers

### Day 3: December 21, 2019



**Today's Progress**: 
 
Did 6 #cplusplus beginner questions from #codechef(mostly very basic ones). But I can see a little change in my coding style and I am learning things(INT_MAX,min(),etc).Questions I solved today are 1.CHOPRT, 2.FLOW008, 3.FLOW005, 4.TWOVSTEN, 5.AMR15A, 6.MDL

Tommorow is the Decmber CookOff and I want to be able to solve atleast 1 question.

Difficult questions coming tomorrow.

### Day 4: December 22, 2019



**Today's Progress**: 

Finally participated in the **December CookOff** and was able to solve 2 questions but one was exceeding the time limit(solution was correct though). And I am happy that I was able to solve them. There was another which I understood & was trying to solve but couldn't do so. 

I also saw vedios of STL by Saurabh Shukla on youtube(I should have seen more). Solved 2 questions, one from codechef and another from spoj. 

Not a bad day but not very productive one either. 

Practice questions are 1.HRDSEQ(CODECHEF), 2.PRIME GENERATOR(SPOJ) and 2 from CookOff 3.CHNGIT, 4.XORIT

2.PRIME GENERATOR 

3.CHNGIT https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/28444654

4.XORIT https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/28449353  (It was not accepted as it exceeded the time limit)


### Day 5: December 23, 2019



**Today's Progress**:

Did 7 questions today but mostly basic ones.Some were very easy like reversing digits(need to focus on little tougher problems). Learnt about **<boost/multiprecision>** in #cplusplus. 

**<boost/multiprecision>** helps to do deal with large numbers(life saver). Because of it was finally able to solve a factorial problem which dealt with large numbers. 

Learning new things everyday. Would try some difficult problems tomorrow. 

Problems I did today are 1.FCTRL2, 2.FLOW017, 3.FLOW018, 4.FLOW007, 5.FLOW004, 6.FLOW001, 7.ADDING REVERSED NUMBERS

7.ADDING REVERSED NUMBERS (SPOJ)


### Day 6: December 24, 2019



**Today's Progress**:

So I did 6 questions in #cplusplus from @codechef and @spoj.

Learnt to count trailing 0's in a very large number.

Practice, Practice, Practice is the key.

The questions that I did today are 1.SMPAIR, 2.PRB01, 3.PALL01, 4.FLOW013, 5.AREAPERI, 6.FACTORIAL

### Day 7: December 25, 2019



**Today's Progress**:

#100DaysOfCode #cplusplus #programmer #technology

Had a lot of work today. But managed to do 3 questions from codechef.

The questions that I did today are 1.FLOW014, 2.CANDY123, 3.ATM2

### Day 8: December 26, 2019



**Today's Progress**:

#100DaysOfCode #cplusplus #programmer #technology

Did 6 questions from spoj. The level of questions that I did today was higher than the ones I was doing earlier. 

Improving logic, increasing speed. 

Procastination is a big trouble. :P

Need to work on procastination habits, time management and the list goes on.

The #hustle is on.

The questions that I did today 1.NUMBER STEPS, 2.FEYNMAN, 3.SMALL FACTORIALS, 4.WHAT'S NEXT, 5.CANDY 1, 6.FASHION SHOWS 

I repeated the factorial question today as it had a new concept that i learnt few days back which helps to handle the large numbers. So it was a brush up.

(No links. All the problems were from  spoj)




### Day 9: December 27, 2019



**Today's Progress**:

#100DaysOfCode #cplusplus #programmer 

Did 6 questions from codechef. And also learnt few concepts of stack in #cplusplus as well as stl implementation of stack.

practice,practice,practice(as i said earlier) is the key. 

And I am happy because I learnt new concepts in some of the questions.

The questions that I did are 1.POTATOES, 2.LONGSEQ, 3.RECTANGL, 4.RECTSQ, 5.MUFFINS3, 6.ONP
